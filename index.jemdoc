For a class of decentralized non-convex optimizations problems, this work aims both reducing the /total communication rounds/ among the nodes while accessing the /minimum number of local data samples/. In particular, we propose an algorithm named *D-GET*, which jointly performs /decentralized gradient estimation/ (which estimates the local gradient using a subset of local samples) and /gradient tracking/ (which tracks the global full gradient using local estimates). 

The left figure illustrates that our D-GET algorithm significantly improves upon the best existing bounds in terms of both sample complexity and communication complexity.  Note that there are m nodes in the system, and we treat the graph parameters such as eigengaps of Laplacian matrices as constants.

#-- Address the fundamental question: For a class of unconstrained non-convex problems with Lipschitz continuous gradient, by only utilizing local gradient information, what is the *fastest rate* that distributed algorithms can achieve, and *how* to achieve those rates.

This paper discusses the fundamental performance for distributed non-convex optimization, where  multiple nodes collectively optimize some non-convex function using local data. For a class of non-convex problems, we develop an "optimal" distributed algorithm called *xFILTER*, in the sense that it achieves the *best possible convergence rate* for a class of first-order distributed algorithms.  

In the left figure, we illustrate the results derived in this paper (both the lower bound and xFILTER bound), by comparing them with the rates of an non-optimal D-GPDA method, and the centralized gradient descent (GD) methods (over a path graph with M nodes, to achieve certain $\epsilon$-solution). The xFILTER can significantly reduce both \# of gradient evaluations, and \# of communication rounds among the distributed nodes.

This paper address both the theoretical and practical aspects of deep learning based algorithm approximation with applications to wireless resource management. The key idea is to treat the input and output of an SP algorithm as an unknown nonlinear mapping and use a deep neural network (DNN) to approximate it. If the nonlinear mapping can be learned accurately by a DNN of moderate size, then SP tasks can be performed effectively — since passing the input through a DNN only requires a small number of simple operations.

[http://www.ece.virginia.edu/~nds5j/index.html Prof. Nikos Sidiropoulos (ECE at University of Virginia)] gave a Keynote at ICC Workshop ``Machine Learning for Communications'' about this paper. See the slides [NikosICC2018ML4COMslides.pdf here].

The IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc) has provided a list of papers for “[https://www.comsoc.org/publications/best-readings/machine-learning-communications Best Readings in Machine Learning in Communications]”. This paper is included in this list for ‘‘resource allocation’’.
